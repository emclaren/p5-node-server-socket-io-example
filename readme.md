Simple example of using server using socket.io to transmit data from one browser window to another. 

Slightly modified version is live online here: https://secure-sierra-92770.herokuapp.com/

Based off the example from the Coding Rainbow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjULmG8fqc8

To run locally you will need node.js installed https://nodejs.org/en/
 


From the terminal:

use the cd command to enter into the directory

running  `npm install` will download any required packages
running `node server.js` will run the application on port 8000 

You will need to open up two windows to http://localhost:8000/ in order to view

Click anddrag your mouse to paint in both browser windows simultaneously
